When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

A remote repository works out well to save files off your system
for reduncey.  It also works out well for multiple people working
on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

So you can be in control.  You might be doing multiple commits
locally and you don't want all of them on the repository.  You
might be waiting until the project is complete.
