What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git file is created with metadata.  You need to do it so you can work with github to save your work.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

You don't work on files in the staging area, it is just a holding location before the repository.  The working directory is where you do your file edits, an area to work on files.
